* construct the basal domains by extending 5000bp to upstream and 1000bp to downsteram of TSS.
* calculate distances to neighbour regions.
* extend to both sides until reaching the neighbour genes or to the maximal extension.
* check gene ID type in `gene_sets` and in `extended_tss`.
* use self-defined background regions.
* remove excluded regions from background.
* overlap `gr` to background regions (based on midpoint).
* in total 1011 `gr`.
* overlap extended TSS to background regions.
* check which genes are in the gene sets.
* only take gene sets with size >= 5.
* in total 411 gene sets.
* overlap `gr` to every extended TSS.
* perform binomial test for each biological term.
